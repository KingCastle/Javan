			<h3>THE ORDER COMPLETE PAGE</h3>

			<p class="text-justify">This message means that we have accepted your order and will be able to fulfill your
				request. Nothing further is required on your part, unless you want to make a last minute adjustment to your
				order, in which case please call us ASAP and quote your order number. We will do our best to help.</p>

			<p class="text-danger"><strong>Status: Order Rejected</strong></p>

			<p class="text-justify">If you are seeing this message after you have completed your order then it means we have
				declined and cancelled the order you had made. We would normally provide you with a reason as to why we couldn't
				take the order. Most likely is that we ran out of the food you wanted or we were too busy to deliver on time. If
				you had paid online then we would refund any money to you automatically however please allow up to 5 working
				days for the refund to come through. We may ask you to retry your order. If you have any questions then you can
				call us on 020 8563 8553. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused and we really appreciate your custom.</p>
			<h3>MARKETING & NEWSLETTERS</h3>
			<p class="text-justify">From time to time we will run promotions. Sometimes we like to notify our customers about
				these offers by emails, SMS, post or telephone calls. You can opt in or out of our marketing and newsletters
				easily online at anytime. Newsletter preferences can be customised from the members area. You need to login, or
				register to be able to access this. We don't send many marketing mailshots, but when we do we think it's
				something you'll want to know about!</p>
			<h3>HOW TO OPT IN</h3>

			<p class="text-justify">To opt in to our mailshot marketing, please either login or register on our members page.
				If you are registering, you will be asked if you want to receive such marketing. For those whom have already
				registered, please login to the members area and visit the "My Profile" page, you can change your preferences
				from the "Notification & Marketing Preferences" section near the bottom.</p>
			<h3>HOW TO OPT OUT</h3>

			<p class="text-justify">To opt out of our mailshot marketing, please either login or register on our members page.
				If you are registering, you will be asked if you want to receive such marketing. For those whom have already
				registered, please login to the members area and visit the "My Profile" page, you can change your preferences
				from the "Notification & Marketing Preferences" section near the bottom. You must register an account if you
				wish to opt out, this is so that we can store a list people who do not want to receive marketing. If we didn't
				get you to register and just removed your number, then it's possible to still get the marketing if your data is
				imported to our system again. By registering it is a permanent opt out. If you opt out of Persian Palace
				marketing, then you will be opted out from all of our branches. Opting out of marketing communications does not
				stop you receiving some one-off emails like your order confirmations and password resets etc.</p>
